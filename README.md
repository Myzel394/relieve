## Note regarding the original app

The original app to Relieve is [Quid Faciam Hodie?](https://github.com/Myzel394/quid_faciam_hodie). This app was submitted as part of the [Supabase Hackathon 2022](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon). This app isn't maintained anymore. Relieve doesn't rely on Supabase and will be maintained.
